##React Starter Template

I created this template because I couldn't find a solution that fitted my needs.
This starter template uses webpack to bundle all js and scss into one file.

Neat and Bourbon are implemented into this template.

I chose to have a general implementation of my sass files, meaning all sass will be compiled every single time.
However this may not fit your needs.

###Installing the project
This project requires NodeJs to be installed.
Install the package by typing: `npm install` in Terminal or CMD(as admin).

###Running the development server
`node dev-server` starts a dev-server on port 3000, you can access your page [here](http://localhost:3000)

###I also included a way to build your files for production.
you can run the production bundler with `npm run build-prod`

I use this starter template for most of my projects .
